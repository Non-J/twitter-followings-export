# Twitter Followings Export

After the recent acquisition, the odds seem to be stacked against Twitter, Inc. Current financial trajectory suggest the service might not be able to pay its ongoing cost to maintain availability and could be gone any day. This tool saves the list of people you follow along with the descriptions, so that if it really did go down, there's at least a list and potentially links to other places they can remain in touch.

The tool is quickly cobbled together in a race of time, so the quality is rather lacking.
